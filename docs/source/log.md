Log
===

The pipeline generates a log file following the naming convention: yyyy_mm_dd_hrs_mins_secs_analysisname.log.txt and tracks each event/command. The log file sections follow standard [Python logging conventions](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html):

***INFO*** to print STDOUT messages;

***DEBUG*** to print commands ran by pipeline,

***ERROR*** to print STDERR messages and

***EXCEPTION*** to print an exception that occured while the pipeline was running.
